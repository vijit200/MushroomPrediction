# Data Description
**The client will send data in multiple sets of files in batches at a 
given location. Data will contain 23 columns . The Class 
column will tell weather mushroom is poisonous or eatable.
Class column will have two unique values e and p. 
“e" represents mushroom is eatable.
“p" represents mushroom is poisonous. 
Apart from training files, we also require a "schema" file from 
the client, which contains all the relevant information about 
the training files such as:
Name of the files, Length of Date value in Filename, Length of 
Time value in Filename, Number of Columns, Name of the 
Columns, and their datatype**
